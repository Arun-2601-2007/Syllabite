Syllabite ðŸŽ“

Syllabite is an educational web platform designed to make learning easier for students. It provides subject-wise playlists, notes, PYQs, and college club details, all organized by department and semester. Students can also contribute resources, such as YouTube playlists or PDFs, to help peers access study materials in one place.

The platform features user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access. Users can add playlists, upload notes or PDFs, and explore club information. CRUD operations are implemented for managing resources, making the platform interactive and easy to maintain.

Built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, EJS templates for the frontend, MongoDB Atlas for the database, and Cloudinary for media uploads, Syllabite is deployed on Render for a smooth online experience.

To use locally, clone the repository, install dependencies (npm install), set up the .env file with your database and Cloudinary credentials, and run npm start. Navigate to Department â†’ Semester â†’ Subject to view or contribute resources, selecting the correct course number when adding playlists or files.
